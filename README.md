# Quantitative-Sales-Forecasting-Using-Time-Series-and-Causal-Models
Date: May'24 - June'24<br>

In a personal endeavor to learn about time series analysis and forecasting, this
 project explores various quantitative forecasting methods. The methods dis
cussed in this report can be applied to forecast product sales, along with a
 detailed explanation of the different metrics used to evaluate the forecasts.
 
 Goal: The goal of this project was to apply various quantitative methods,
 such as Time Series Models and Causal Models, to forecast the sales of the
 products available in the dataset obtained from Kaggle.
 
 Models covered in this report include:<br>
 • Seasonal Naive Model<br>
 • Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)<br>
 • ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Models<br>
 • Linear Regression Model
